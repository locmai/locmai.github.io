Hi! 
I am a Software Test Engineer at KMS Technology. 

I've been mostly focused on researching for Performance testing solutions for a year. And throughout the process, I've learned many things from my colleagues. 

After a while, I started doing something new like building test automation framework with Java, working with Linux systems and optimize servers' configurations, working with data and building pet projects with Python.

For now, I'm just trying my best to be the better version of myself.

Hope you will enjoy reading my blog posts.
