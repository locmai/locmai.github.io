Hi! 
I am studying Software Engineering. I have a firm fundamental of requirement engineering, design, coding, testing and overall the software development.

Until now I have programming with Java,C# and doing some mini Android projects. I'm going to focus more on Java and Python this year.

For now Iâ€™m an R&D Intern in Testing at [KMS Technology](kms-technology.com) which open many challenges for me in the Software Testing field. 

This blog is for my goals tracking and practice to improve my English writing skills.

I'm also a big fan of Linkin Park, Hip Hop music and Japanese culture.
